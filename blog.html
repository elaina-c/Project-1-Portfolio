    <h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
    
    <p>My name is <b>Elaine G. Lim</b>, and I’m a passionate and curious learner with a strong interest in web development, technology, and continuous self-improvement.</p>

    <p>Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by how things work—especially the digital tools and websites that connect people across the globe. This curiosity led me to dive into the world of web development, where I found a perfect blend of creativity, logic, and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m a student at <b>Uplift Code Camp</b>, where I’m honing my skills in front-end development, learning how to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every project I work on teaches me something new and challenges me to grow—not just as a developer, but also as a thinker and creator.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I believe in the power of meaningful design. I love creating digital experiences that are not only functional but also visually appealing and accessible to everyone. I enjoy working on personal projects, collaborating with peers, and continuously exploring new technologies and frameworks.</p>

    <p>When I’m not glued to my code editor, you’ll find me drawing, singing, making scrapbooks, taking walks, and spending time with the people I love. These hobbies keep me grounded and inspired, and they often influence the creative side of my coding projects.</p>

    <p>My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to building tools and platforms that make a real difference in people’s lives—whether it's helping small businesses establish their online presence or building apps that solve everyday problems.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my site—I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p>
